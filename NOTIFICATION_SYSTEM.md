# 🔔 Personalized Notification System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
A comprehensive, event-driven notification system has been implemented to provide personalized notifications to users based on their specific activities, events, and interactions with other users.

## What Was Built

### 1. **Notification Service** (`notification-service.js`)
A centralized service that handles all notification creation with preset methods for different event types:

#### Offer-Related Notifications
- `notifyOfferReceived()` - When a provider sends an offer
- `notifyOfferAccepted()` - When an offer is accepted
- `notifyOfferRejected()` - When an offer is declined

#### Booking-Related Notifications
- `notifyBookingConfirmed()` - When booking is confirmed
- `notifyBookingCancelled()` - When booking is cancelled
- `notifyBookingCompleted()` - When service is complete

#### Message Notifications
- `notifyNewMessage()` - When receiving a direct message

#### Payment Notifications
- `notifyPaymentReceived()` - When payment is received
- `notifyPaymentFailed()` - When payment fails

#### Service Request Notifications
- `notifyNewServiceRequest()` - When new request is posted

#### Review Notifications
- `notifyReviewReceived()` - When receiving a review
- `notifyReviewResponse()` - When provider responds to review

#### Profile Activity Notifications
- `notifyProfileViewed()` - When someone views your profile

#### Service Management
- `notifyServiceApproved()` - Service approved by admin
- `notifyServiceRejected()` - Service needs adjustment

#### Account/Admin Notifications
- `notifyAccountVerification()` - Account verification status
- `notifyPayout()` - Payout processed

### 2. **Enhanced Notifications Page** (`notifications.html` & `notifications.js`)

Features:
- ✅ Real-time notification loading with Firestore listeners
- ✅ Personalized per user (only their notifications shown)
- ✅ Click to mark individual notifications as read
- ✅ "Mark all as read" button
- ✅ Color-coded notification categories
- ✅ Emoji icons for quick visual recognition
- ✅ Time formatting (relative times: "Just now", "2h ago", etc.)
- ✅ Notification filtering by type/category
- ✅ Beautiful UI with gradients and hover effects

### 3. **Real-Time Badge** (`notification-badge.js`)

Features:
- ✅ Shows unread notification count
- ✅ Only counts unread notifications via Firestore query
- ✅ Real-time updates using `onSnapshot` listener
- ✅ Pulse animation on badge for visual feedback
- ✅ Auto-hides when no unread notifications
- ✅ Supports 99+ for high notification counts

### 4. **Data Structure**

Each notification stored in Firestore includes:
```javascript
{
  userId: String,           // User who receives notification
  type: String,             // Notification type (offer_received, booking_confirmed, etc.)
  title: String,            // Display title
  message: String,          // Display message
  metadata: Object,         // Related data (offerId, customerId, amount, etc.)
  relatedUserId: String,    // User who triggered the notification
  read: Boolean,            // Read status
  createdAt: Timestamp,     // Creation time
  updatedAt: Timestamp      // Last update time
}
```

### 5. **Firestore Security Rules**

```firestore
match /notifications/{notificationId} {
  // Any authenticated user can read any notification
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Any authenticated user can create notifications
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Only the recipient (userId) can update/delete their notifications
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
                          request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}
```

## How It Works

### User Activity Flow:
1. User accepts an offer → `notifyOfferAccepted()` is called
2. Notification is created in Firestore with the provider's userId
3. Provider's notification badge updates automatically (real-time)
4. When provider opens notifications page, they see only their notifications
5. Provider clicks notification → marked as read
6. Badge count decreases automatically

### Integration Points:
- **my-requests.js**: Generates notifications when offers are rejected/accepted
- **payment.js**: Generates booking and payment notifications
- **Other files**: Can use `NotificationService` methods

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project "vora-d8987"
3. Go to Firestore Database → Rules
4. Copy the rules from `firestore.rules` file
5. Ensure the notifications section looks like:
   ```
   match /notifications/{notificationId} {
     allow read: if request.auth != null;
     allow create: if request.auth != null;
     allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
                             request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
   }
   ```
6. Publish the rules

### Step 2: Verify Implementation
1. All files are already updated:
   - ✅ `notification-service.js` - Created
   - ✅ `notifications.js` - Enhanced with styling
   - ✅ `notification-badge.js` - Real-time updates
   - ✅ `my-requests.js` - Integrated NotificationService
   - ✅ `payment.js` - Integrated NotificationService

### Step 3: Test the System
1. Log in as Provider (or create test account)
2. Create a service offering
3. Log in as different user (Customer)
4. Send an offer for a service
5. Check Provider's notification badge (should show "1")
6. Open notifications page
7. See personalized notification with offer details
8. Click to mark as read (badge count decreases)

## Notification Categories

| Category | Icon | Color | Types |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Offers | 💰 | Blue | offer_received, offer_accepted, offer_rejected |
| Bookings | 📅 | Purple | booking_confirmed, booking_cancelled, booking_completed |
| Messages | 💬 | Indigo | new_message |
| Payments | 💳 | Green | payment_received, payment_failed |
| Requests | 📋 | Yellow | new_request |
| Reviews | ⭐ | Amber | review_received, review_response |
| Activity | 👀 | Gray | profile_viewed |
| Services | ✅ | Green | service_approved, service_rejected |
| Account | 🔐 | Blue | verification_update |
| Payouts | 💰 | Green | payout_processed |

## Key Features

✅ **Personalized**: Each user only sees notifications for their activities
✅ **Real-time**: Uses Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners for instant updates
✅ **Event-driven**: Notifications created by specific user actions
✅ **Categorized**: Different types with different colors and icons
✅ **Unread Tracking**: Only unread count is fetched from Firestore
✅ **Read Management**: Mark individual or all as read
✅ **User Context**: Shows which user triggered the notification
✅ **Scalable**: Service methods for easy expansion to new notification types

## Usage Example

```javascript
// When a provider accepts an offer
await NotificationService.notifyOfferAccepted(
  providerId,        // Provider receives notification
  customerId,        // Customer who triggered it
  5000               // Offer amount
);

// Results in notification showing:
// "✅ Offer Accepted"
// "Your offer of ₦5,000 has been accepted. Proceed to complete the booking."
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing or insufficient permissions" error
**Solution**: Deploy the Firestore rules as described in Installation Step 1

### Issue: Badge not showing count
**Solution**: Ensure user is logged in and has `notificationBadge` element on the page

### Issue: Notifications not appearing
**Solution**: 
1. Check user is logged in
2. Verify Firestore rules are deployed
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure `userId` field is set when creating notifications
